# Stone Packaging - Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to download and install the [Stone](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover) binaries, based on your operating system (OS) and architecture so follow along.

## Supported Architectures

Stone binaries are available for the following architectures:
- **x86_64 Linux**
- **ARM64 macOS**

## Download and Install Binaries

### For macOS (ARM64)

1. Download the cpu_air_prover and cpu_air_verifier binaries:

```bash
wget https://github.com/dipdup-io/stone-packaging/releases/latest/download/cpu_air_prover-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover
wget https://github.com/dipdup-io/stone-packaging/releases/latest/download/cpu_air_verifier-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier
```
2. Make the binaries executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier
```

3. Move the binaries to /usr/bin for system-wide access (optional):

```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover /usr/bin/
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier /usr/bin/
```

This step is optional but recommended if you want to make the binaries globally available without adding /usr/local/bin to your PATH.

### For Linux (x86_64)

1. Download the `cpu_air_prover` and `cpu_air_verifier` binaries:

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/dipdup-io/stone-packaging/releases/latest/download/cpu_air_prover-x86_64 -O /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover
sudo wget https://github.com/dipdup-io/stone-packaging/releases/latest/download/cpu_air_verifier-x86_64 -O /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier
```

2. Make the binaries executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier
```

3. Move the binaries to /usr/bin for system-wide access (optional):

```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_prover /usr/bin/
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/cpu_air_verifier /usr/bin/
```

This step is actually optional but recommended if you want to make the binaries globally available without adding /usr/local/bin to your PATH.

## Adding Stone Binaries to the System PATH

If you prefer to leave the binaries in /usr/local/bin or any other folder, you can add that folder to your systemâ€™s PATH variable. This will ensure that the binaries can be executed from any directory.

1. Open your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc for bash, .zshrc for zsh):

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc # for bash users
nano ~/.zshrc # for zsh users
```

2. Add the following line to include /usr/local/bin in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Save and close the file, then reload your shell to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc 
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

This step ensures that binaries placed in /usr/local/bin can be accessed from anywhere in your system without needing to move them to /usr/bin.

### Verifying Installation

After placing the binaries or updating the PATH, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
cpu_air_prover --help
cpu_air_verifier --help
```

If you see usage information, then the installation is successful. Hope you're smilling.
